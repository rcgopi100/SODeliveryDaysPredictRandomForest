# SODeliveryDaysPredictRandomForest
We have seen in our previous blog posts Customer delivery days Prediction on Machine Learning Scikit Learn Linear Regression and Decision Tree models.

Also, we have gone through Customer Sales Order Price rediction using the Machine Learning Scikit Linear Regression, Decision Tree model and Random Forest models.

In this post, we will work on Customer Sales Order Delivery time/Days Prediction using the Scikit Learn Random Regression model (copy most of the codes from Customer Sales Order delivery time/days prediction) and check how it performs. 

Let’s start and see how the Random Forest Regression predicts “Delivery days data” and you can also download from GitHub on my repository SODeliveryDaysPredictRandomForest.

You can visit my webiste for all data and blog posts too.
